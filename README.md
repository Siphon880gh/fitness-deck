## Prompts

### Stretches

Prompts A-B

Prompt A:
```
Give me as many exercises as possible to: Stretch the quadriceps with a focus on increasing flexibility. 

That is the goal of the prompt. Please remember that goal for all subsequent prompts.

Please give me a markdown table. First column are the exercises. In 5 columns, give the easier and harder variations based on difficulty level. Those columns are: Easiest Variation, Easier variation, Standard variation, Harder variation, Hardest variation.
```

Prompt B (may be repeated):
```
Is this a good place to stop? It is if it's going to be all slight variations. Otherwise, try to give as many as possible so I can ask you less often. Please do not have duplicates. Tell me how many exercises so far after the table.
```
